# Privacy Statement

We (the repository owners) don't intentionally collect any information about your use of this bot. If you catch something, this is a bug - please open an issue.

Upstream's version [tracks a scary amount of information](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/blob/master/bot.py#L1451) like your server name, modmail bot's name, owner Discord tags, etc. [Here is their privacy statement.](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/blob/development/PRIVACY.md) The tracking code has been removed entirely from this fork. In my opinion, if you have to have a file explaining the data you track, you're tracking too much.
